**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:** 
  - Outage Start: November 1, 2023, 12:00 PM (GMT+2)
  - Outage End: November 1, 2023, 6:00 PM (GMT+2)
- **Impact:**
  - Registration services for VOD (Video on Demand) were disrupted.
  - Users were unable to complete registrations, experiencing a 75% failure rate.

**Root Cause:**

The outage was caused by a high failure rate in the mail server, disrupting the registration process for users.

**Timeline:**

- **12:00 PM (GMT+2):** 
  - Issue detected through system monitoring, showing a significant spike in failed registration attempts.
- **12:15 PM (GMT+2):** 
  - Investigation initiated, focusing on the registration process and server logs.
- **1:30 PM (GMT+2):** 
  - Initially assumed the issue was with the registration server's database due to high traffic.
- **2:45 PM (GMT+2):** 
  - Database and server logs analyzed, ruling out issues with the database but noticing communication failures with the mail server.
- **4:00 PM (GMT+2):** 
  - Incident escalated to the DevOps team and the mail server team for joint investigation.
- **5:30 PM (GMT+2):** 
  - Root cause identified: mail server overload leading to registration failure.
- **6:00 PM (GMT+2):** 
  - Temporary fix implemented: Push notifications used as an alternative to handle registration traffic.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- **Root Cause:**
  - High failure rate in the mail server due to an unexpected influx of registration traffic. The mail server became overwhelmed and failed to process requests effectively.

- **Resolution:**
  - Push notifications were introduced as an alternative to manage the high registration traffic, alleviating the load on the mail server. The notifications bypassed the mail server, allowing successful user registrations.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Improvements:**
  - Implement a more robust and scalable mail server architecture to handle sudden traffic spikes.
  - Enhance monitoring systems to promptly identify and respond to mail server overload.
  
- **Tasks:**
  - Upgrade mail server infrastructure for scalability.
  - Develop failover mechanisms for mail servers to handle overload.
  - Implement real-time traffic monitoring and automatic notification routing.

This incident emphasizes the necessity of system scalability and robustness in the face of unexpected traffic surges. The integration of push notifications as a backup solution highlights the importance of flexible alternatives when traditional pathways fail. Moving forward, a more resilient mail server infrastructure and proactive monitoring systems will be pivotal in preventing similar outages.

This postmortem serves as a key learning opportunity, driving the enhancement of our system's architecture and response mechanisms, ensuring smoother service delivery even during unexpected peaks in user activity.
